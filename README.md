## BDD

> The web application will require the user to input gender and their date of birth.
> The application calculates the day of the week the user was born which is a number between 0 and 6 corresponding to the days of the week where 0 is Sunday and 6 is Saturday.
> The application matches the day of the week with the akan Name depending on their gender. For example if the user was born on Friday then their akan name would be Kofi for male and Akua for female. The application outputs the result as a personalized message.
